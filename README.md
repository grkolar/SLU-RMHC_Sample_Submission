# SLU-RMHC_Sample_Submission
These resources describe how to submit samples or reserve time on instruments via the RMHC Calpendo system.

## Getting Started with SLU Calpendo Website 

Go to https://slu-mhc.calpendo.com/ and click Register new user.

***Note: The website will eventually be connected to Okta. To that end, make sure your username is the same as your Okta/SLU username***

After approval, the first page you see upon logging in is the **Information Pages**. These contain a list of equipment, services, submission policies, and frequently asked questions. Navigation between the pages is on the left side of the screen.

## Projects

On the navigation bar, hover your mouse over **Projects** to access the dropdown menu. *A project is generally set up to be the equivalent of a grant.* A project can be used for multiple sample submissions or bookings. *Each sample submission or booking time must be associated with a project and each project must have a fund number.* How the projects are defined for your lab will depend on the Principal Investigator.



Note: A project should only be made with PI approval. Ideally, PIâ€™s will be the owner of any project associated with their lab. This will allow them to keep track of any sample submissions or equipment bookings for their lab.  

To see a list of all the projects, select Project Search from the dropdown menu. To join a project, select **Project Membership Request** and enter the appropriate project code or email the owner of the project or Caroline Murphy (caroline.murphy.1@health.slu.edu). The project code can be found under **Project Search**.  

All the projects you are part of will be listed under **My Projects**. 

To create a project, select **Create Project**. The name of the project will be what is listed when selecting a project to associate with a service request or equipment booking. The fund number is the grant or account associated with that project. The type is either Internal (SLU lab) or external.  


For each project, select **Project Service Settings** then **Choose services*. 

A pop-up with **Service Selection** will appear as shown above. From the dropdown menu, select any services that this project/grand/fund number can be used for. You can edit this at any time and a list will show up on the right.  

Then select **Project Resource Settings** then **Choose resources**.


A new pop-up wil appear with a list of available resources that can be booked. Select the ones that will be used in association with the project and click **Ok**. The selected resources will be listed to the right and can be changed at any time. 

Finally, select **Users** and add the people you want to have access to this project for specimen submission and booking equipment.  

When finished, click **Save** in the upper left hand corner.  

## Submitting Samples
To submit a sample, select **Available Services** from the drop down menu under **Services**. The majority of labs will be using the service shown below. Select **Order** from the upper right corner of the box. The RMHC service is for specimen submission as described in the box. Submission guidelines (such as fixation) can be found on the **Information Pages** drop-down menu.
